It’s 11th February, Promise Day. I honestly don’t know what to say. The last few days have just been… a lot. I know you would’ve expected something, and I couldn’t even do it properly. I don’t have any excuses.

I’m not promising that every day will be perfect, but I promise I’ll be there holding your hand on those imperfect days. I promise I’ll be there when you’re tired of everything. I’ll understand you when no one else does. I promise I’ll listen to your rants, and yes, your silence too. I promise I’ll keep you safe and secure in my arms when everything feels heavy. I promise I’ll love you even when you don’t like yourself. I’ll love you in your highs and lows, your ups and downs. I’ll love you every single day, every hour, minute, second and even more with each passing moment.

I know I’m not good enough. I know I can’t do everything, can’t always make moments or days beautiful or memorable, and I might even ruin them sometimes. But nothing can change the fact that I love you more than anything. I don’t need special days to make you feel loved or special. I love you every day.

And I promise I’ll be better. I’ll improve.

And the most important thing— I love you.</p>
