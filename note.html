                            So here it is… finally.<br>
                            You said that day, “puchhna padta hai!” — puchhna? This is for you, baby.<br>

                            My sunshine, thank you for lighting up my world every single day. Thank you for being mine, for choosing
                            me, and for loving me so unconditionally. You make everything feel warmer, softer, and so much better
                            just by being you.

                            Valentine’s Day may be just one day, but you matter to me every single day of the year. Still… let me
                            celebrate you today, because you deserve it all.<br>
                            <br>

                            Happy Valentine’s Day, babyy.<br>
                            Our first one,how could I not make it special?<br>

                            Lots and lots of love. 💗❤️</p>
